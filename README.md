# Genetic Algorithm for Best-Fit Circle

## Overview

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to find the best-fit circle within a set of other circles. The algorithm iteratively evolves a population of circles, selecting and modifying individuals to optimize the fitness function â€“ in this case, the ability to fit within the given set of circles.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/genetic-circle-fitting.git
   cd genetic-circle-fitting

## Usage

2. **Run with Live Server:**
   To visualize and interact with the project, it is recommended to run it using a live server. Follow these steps:

   - Open the project in your favorite code editor.
   - Launch a live server to run the project. You can use extensions like "Live Server" for Visual Studio Code or any other live server tool.

     For example, using Visual Studio Code and the "Live Server" extension:
     - Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
     - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server."

   This will open the project in your default web browser, allowing you to interact with the Genetic Algorithm for Best-Fit Circle in real-time.
